            Exported from SeleniumIDE tests have long term maintainability issues:
            mixing locators, user actions and assertions. This means AUT changes will require
            many of the same fixes to be applied across many tests and files. Using the POM
            separates concerns. The Test asks the POM page to perform actions and return results
            (if necessary), the test then asserts on those results. The test itself does not care
            about the details of /how/ an action is performed. Thats the job of the POM. 

            If the AUT changes, fix the POM (generally) not the test. POM pages can be shared
            across many tests.

            As a side benefit, the test itself becomes much more readable.
